 Right click on the project and select Run As Maven Test
 Can be run as JUnit Test also.



Improvements that could be considered to develop the framework :
==> We can use Extent Report in place normal reporting to produce awesome reports which has much more capability to produce test logs and better visual graphics.
==> Since Behavior Driven Development (BDD) is one of the powerful development style. 
    When BDD integrate with agile then it becomes more dynamic.
